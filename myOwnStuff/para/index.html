<!--    
1. add event listener 'scroll' on window object
2. determine which item in your HTML should be chosen to put paralax effect onto
3. add class to the element you've chosen above
4. choose the element via its class and contain it in a variable
5. determine which CSS property of the element you want to target with your JS (you can already do it)
// if we want the parallax effect, we have to change the transform property
6. find a way to determine the amount of pexels that the scrollbar has currently scrolled and somehow
    apply a simple mathematic formula for determining the rate at which the element will scroll
    .---- | window.pageYOffset | ----.
7. create a variable which binds the window.pageYOffset
8. add the class which you've used above to another element
9. if there are several chosen elements, you have to iterate through them. The for loop is pretyUseful here
10. setting up stuff for the 'for' loop: variables index(=0) and lenght(=target.length)
11. inside the loop, use let for defining a variable which will contain information about amount of pexels
    that your chosen elements will be parallaxed. If we want to make it dinamic, instead of defining the
    scroll rate above the 'for' loop, you can do this through data HTML attribute. This attribute isWritten
    in HTML like this:
                        <sometag data-nameofyourdata="value">
    in order to choose it in JS, you have to choose the dataset object and put the value which is defined in
    HTML after a dot:
                        let someV = yourElementInJS.dataset.value
-->    

    <script>
    
        window.addEventListener('scroll', (e) => {
            const words = document.
        })

    </script>
